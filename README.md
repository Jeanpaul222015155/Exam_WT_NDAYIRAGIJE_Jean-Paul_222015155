A property management system (PMS) streamlines the administration of rental properties,
ensuring efficient management of daily operations. It automates tasks such as tenant management, lease information,
and maintenance requests. The system maintains detailed tenant records, tracks lease agreements,
and sends automated rent reminders, facilitating timely rent collection. Maintenance requests can be logged by
tenants through the system, which then assigns tasks to appropriate personnel and tracks the progress. 
Financial reporting features helpproperty managers monitor income, expenses, and profitability. The property 
management system(PMS) also generates invoices and tracks payments, ensuring accurate financial records. 

By providing a centralized platform for managing properties, tenants,and financials,
a PMS enhances operational efficiency, reduces administrative workload, and improves tenant 
satisfaction. Advanced systems may also offer features like online portals for tenants and owners,
making communication and transaction management more convenient.
